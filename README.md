# SAP Operational Data Provisioning(ODP) OData Client with S/4HANA: "Hello World"
For data integration scenarios based on SAP S4/HANA source systems, the following requirements are relevant for designing integration architectures:

•	Logical data models abstracting the complexity SAP source tables and corresponding columns
•	The data source must be delta-/CDC-enabled to avoid full delta loads 
•	Open interfaces and protocols to support the customer demand for cloud-based architectures. 
•	Support of frequent intraday data-loads instead of nightly batches

The updated ODP feature in SAP NW 7.5 is the main technology for achieving the requirements describe above. Further information: ([New ODP feature in SAP NetWeaver 7.5]( https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BI/New+ODP+feature+in+SAP+NetWeaver+7.5))
